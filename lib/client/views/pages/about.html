  <h2>About Us</h2>

  <section>
    <h3>How can I use this site?</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="/">Data for Good</a> is all about <strong>finding and sharing data- and tech-driven projects for social good</strong>. It's basically like <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/" target="_blank">Product Hunt</a> for social good projects (you could also call us <em>"Project Hunt"</em>, but that's too cheap). The idea is to get inspired and to replicate projects in your community.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are more and more people out there who care about apps and data projects that somehow make life better for all of us. Imagine if all those would use <a href="/">Data for Good</a> as their bookmark tool for projects they like. And imagine if others vote their favorite projects up. That way we would have a crowdsourced list of the best data- and tech-driven projects for social good. Users can use <a href="/">Data for Good</a> to get inspired, to get in touch with project owners and to eventually replicate projects in their own community. That's our grand vision - help us make it true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from that you can also use Data for Good as a marketplace. Some project owners are desperate for help. On the other side, some developers and data scientists out there are desperate for using their skills (or improving them) with cool and meaningful projects. Both sides can find each other by using the <a href="/category/help-us">"Help us!"</a> category.

    <h3>Who uses this site?</h3>
    <p>
      This site is dedicated to the crowd out there that wants to use data and web/mobile technology to solve social problems. So it's the <a href="http://opengovdata.io/2014/civic-hacking/" target="_blank">civic hacking</a> community (mostly developers), it's the <a href="http://dssg.io/" target="_blank">data science for social good</a> community (mostly data scientists), it's NGOs, it's public administration, it's the open data and open government movement, it's journalists who love these stories, and whoever is mesmerized by these projects just like we are. Our mission is to bring all these communities together and help them with inspiration and information and by providing a discussion and matchmaking platform. The technology allows us to go beyond borders and that's truly fantastic.

    <p>
      But why don't you <a href="/posts/6dhy2r8JhTwBb65ue">introduce yourself</a>?

    <h3>What about ranking projects?</h3>
    <p>
      How cool would it be to filter out the best, coolest, most effective projects? However, measuring impact is difficult. Until we find a good solution (and we are thinking hard about it), you should sign in and hit the vote button for your favorite projects. Then rank projects by number of votes (View => Best). That way everyone can see which projects the crowd likes best. And that's already a pretty cool feature!

    <h3>Can I post a project?</h3>
    <p>
      Absolutely! Just sign in and hit the post button. And note that our app supports <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/" target="_blank">markdown</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are looking for support for your project, use the category <a href="/category/help-us">"Help us!"</a>.

  <section>
    <h3>Can I also post stuff other than projects?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
          That's a good question. The feedback we got from users so far is divided: 50% want to see only links to projects, 50% want to see all kinds of news. We believe that this site is really useful if there is a strict focus on projects. We might introduce a feature that allows separating projects from other news. <a href="mailto:info@dataforgood.co">Let us know</a> what you think is best.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the meantime we will focus on projects and tweet any news we come across via <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenDataForGood" target="_blank">@opendataforgood</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Apart from that, you can ask questions to the community by using the category <a href="/category/ask-d4g">"Ask D4G"</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What will this site look like in the future?</h3>
    <p>
      That's basically up to you! We do whatever makes sense for the community. You can definitely influence the development of this site: please fill out this little <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hDSn1D0IXIRZlp8Vqb31CPVmkg994aTJNkQhRtIzRFo/viewform?usp=send_form" target="_blank">feedback form</a> or <a href="mailto:info@dataforgood.co">get in touch</a>. We are currently implementing a new design.

    <h3>What's the story of Data for Good?</h3>
    <p>
      Pretty simple: We always missed such a site => went to a <a href="http://www.startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">Startup Weekend</a> => launched the site => kept going because we love what we do. Just after launching, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/16/meet-data-for-good-the-hacker-news-for-showing-off-the-best-data-science-to-help-the-world/" target="_blank">VentureBeat</a> wrote a nice piece about us. We are also featured on <a href="http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/07/data-for-good-data-driven-projects-social-good.html" target="_blank">KDnuggets</a> and <a href="http://www.itbusinessedge.com/blogs/integration/emerging-trend-data-scientist-as-humanitarian-worker.html" target="_blank">ITBusinessEdge</a>.
